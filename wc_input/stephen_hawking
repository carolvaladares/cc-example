However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.

Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

While physics and mathematics may tell us how the universe began, they are not much use in predicting human behavior because there are far too many equations to solve. I'm no better than anyone else at understanding what makes people tick, particularly women.

My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit as well as physically.

Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.

In my school, the brightest boys did math and physics, the less bright did physics and chemistry, and the least bright did biology. I wanted to do math and physics, but my father made me do chemistry because he thought there would be no jobs for mathematicians.

Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.


When one's expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have.

If I had to choose a superhero to be, I would pick Superman. He's everything that I'm not.

Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.
